The FIDIC Red Book 1987 is a set of conditions of contract for works of civil engineering construction, published by the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC). It is one of the most widely used standard forms of contract in the world, especially in developing countries. The FIDIC Red Book 1987 provides a balanced and fair allocation of risks and responsibilities between the employer and the contractor, as well as clear and comprehensive procedures for the administration and management of the contract. The FIDIC Red Book 1987 also includes provisions for dispute resolution, payment methods, and variations.

The FIDIC Red Book 1987 has been updated and supplemented several times since its first publication. The most recent supplement was issued in 1996, which introduced a new option for dispute adjudication boards (DABs), a new method of payment on a lump sum basis, and a new clause for late certification. The FIDIC Red Book 1987 is still widely used today, although it has been superseded by the FIDIC Red Book 1999, which incorporates more modern practices and terminology. However, some employers and contractors may prefer to use the FIDIC Red Book 1987 for its simplicity and familiarity.
 
The FIDIC Red Book 1987 is an essential document for anyone involved in civil engineering projects, whether as an employer, a contractor, a consultant, or a lawyer. It provides a clear and comprehensive framework for the successful delivery of quality works within time and budget. It also helps to avoid or resolve disputes that may arise during the execution of the contract. The FIDIC Red Book 1987 is available in PDF format from various online sources[^1^] [^2^], but it is advisable to purchase a hard copy from the official FIDIC website[^2^] to ensure authenticity and validity.
  
## What are the main features of the FIDIC Red Book 1987?
 
The FIDIC Red Book 1987 consists of two parts: Part I - General Conditions and Part II - Conditions of Particular Application. Part I contains 72 clauses that cover the general aspects of the contract, such as definitions, obligations, risks, liabilities, insurance, performance security, tests, defects, payments, variations, claims, disputes, and termination. Part II contains specific clauses that modify or supplement Part I according to the particular requirements of each project. Part II also includes the appendix to tender, which contains the tender and acceptance forms, the contract agreement, and the schedule of prices.
 
The FIDIC Red Book 1987 is based on the principle of a fixed-price contract with measurement. This means that the contractor agrees to execute the works for a fixed lump sum price, which is subject to adjustment only in certain circumstances. The contractor also agrees to measure the works and provide bills of quantities for payment purposes. The employer agrees to pay the contractor according to the schedule of prices and the measured quantities of work done. The employer also agrees to provide the contractor with all necessary information, drawings, specifications, permits, and access to the site.
 
The FIDIC Red Book 1987 also incorporates the concept of an engineer, who is appointed by the employer to act as his representative and agent in administering and supervising the contract. The engineer has various duties and powers under the contract, such as issuing instructions, approving drawings and materials, certifying payments, determining variations and claims, and deciding disputes. The engineer is expected to act impartially and fairly between the parties, but he is not a neutral arbitrator or mediator. The engineer's decisions are binding on both parties unless they are disputed within a specified time limit.
  
## What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the FIDIC Red Book 1987?
