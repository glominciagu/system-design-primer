# How to Use IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8
 
IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8 is a complete development toolchain for STMicroelectronics' 8-bit STM8 microcontrollers. It provides a user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE), a powerful C/C++ compiler, a comprehensive debugger, and an integrated code analysis tool. In this article, we will show you how to get started with IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8 and create a simple project.
 
## Installing IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8
 
To install IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8, you need to download the installer from the IAR website[^1^]. You can choose either a 14-days trial version or a size-limited version. The trial version allows you to use all the features of the toolchain for 14 days, while the size-limited version limits the code size to 4 KB. After downloading the installer, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to enter your license information or request a trial license during the installation process.

## Creating a Project
 
To create a new project in IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8 and select **File > New > Workspace**.
2. Enter a name and location for your workspace and click **OK**.
3. In the **Project > Create New Project** dialog box, select **C Executable Project** and click **OK**.
4. In the **Select Device** dialog box, choose your target device from the list of STM8 devices and click **OK**.
5. In the **Select Project Template** dialog box, choose **Blink LED** as an example project template and click **OK**.
6. A new project with the name *Blink LED* will be created in your workspace. You can see the project files in the **Workspace window**.

## Building and Debugging the Project
 
To build and debug your project, you need to connect your STM8 device to your computer using a debug probe, such as ST-Link[^2^]. Then, follow these steps:

1. Select your project in the **Workspace window** and click **Project > Make**. This will compile your source code and generate an executable file.
2. Select **Project > Download and Debug**. This will download your executable file to your device and launch the C-SPY Debugger[^3^]. You can see the source code, disassembly code, registers, memory, breakpoints, watch variables, call stack, and other debugging information in different windows.
3. In the C-SPY Debugger, click **Go**. This will start running your program on your device. You should see an LED blinking on your device.
4. To stop running your program, click **Stop**. You can then set breakpoints, step through your code, modify variables, evaluate expressions, and perform other debugging actions.
5. To exit the C-SPY Debugger, click **Project > Stop Debugging**.
