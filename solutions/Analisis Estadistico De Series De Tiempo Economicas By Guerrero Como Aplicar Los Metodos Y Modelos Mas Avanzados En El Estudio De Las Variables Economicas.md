# How to use Guerrero's book to learn about time series analysis in economics
 
Time series analysis is a branch of statistics that deals with the study of data collected over time. It is widely used in economics to understand and forecast various phenomena, such as inflation, GDP, unemployment, exchange rates, etc. Time series analysis involves identifying patterns, trends, cycles, and relationships in the data, as well as testing hypotheses and building models.

One of the most comprehensive and accessible books on time series analysis in economics is *AnÃ¡lisis estadÃ­stico de series de tiempo econÃ³micas* by VÃ­ctor M. Guerrero. This book, written in Spanish, covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of time series analysis, with an emphasis on econometric applications. The book has two editions: the first one was published in 1993 and the second one in 2003.
 
The book is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter introduces the concept of time series and some basic tools for their analysis, such as graphs, descriptive statistics, autocorrelation, and stationarity. The second chapter presents the elements of difference equations, which are useful for modeling dynamic systems. The third chapter explains the models for univariate time series, such as autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. The fourth chapter discusses how to construct models for univariate time series, using methods such as identification, estimation, diagnostic checking, and forecasting. The fifth chapter deals with the analysis of seasonal time series, which have periodic fluctuations that depend on the time of the year. The sixth chapter shows how to make forecasts with ARIMA models, which are generalizations of ARMA models that can handle non-stationary data. The seventh chapter explores the analysis of time series influenced by interventions, such as policy changes or external shocks. The eighth chapter covers some other topics of univariate time series analysis, such as spectral analysis, nonlinear models, and long memory processes. The ninth chapter introduces the models for multivariate time series, such as vector autoregressive (VAR), vector error correction (VEC), and cointegration models.
 
The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of economics who want to learn about time series analysis in a rigorous and applied way. It is also useful for researchers and practitioners who need to analyze economic data using time series methods. The book assumes some basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics. It also requires some familiarity with econometric software, such as EViews or RATS.
 
The book can be downloaded as a PDF file from various online sources. However, it is recommended to buy a hard copy from a reputable publisher or bookstore to support the author and ensure the quality of the material.
